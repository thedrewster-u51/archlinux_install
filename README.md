# Archlinux Installation Guides

The Archlinux documentation is quite expansive. Sometimes, you just want a nice set of instructions for your particular use case.

What I'm trying to do here, is document some example Archlinux installs.

I want to break them down into diffirent mix of configurations using various setups with:

 - EFI 
 - BIOS
 - Luks Encryption (luks1)
 - Luks Encryption (luks2)
 - BTRFS
 - LVM
 
 etc.
